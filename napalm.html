                    <p>Napalm, also called firebomb fuel gel mixture, is a jelly-like substance that comes from a powder mixed with gasoline.
                    It is highly flammable, causing it to ignite on impact with a target, burning at over 2,760&#176;C. Compared to previous
                    technologies, napalm burns longer, is harder to extinguish, and can stick to the target due to its consistency, causing
                    fatal injuries. Although napalm was created in 1942 during the Second World War (WWII) and was used to bomb Japanese
                    cities, the technology's arguably most notable impact came later on, during the Vietnam War, when a new easy-to-make
                    variant was created by mixing gasoline, benzene, and polystyrene, and it was pushed into the public eye.

                    </p>
                    <p>In 1965, the Pentagon requested bids from 17 US companies making polystyrene, with one winning bid being from the Dow
                    Chemical company in Michigan. The Dow company ranked 75th on a 1967 list of military contractors, and it was largely
                    known for making Saran Wrap. However, soon, it became the military's only supplier of napalm, and knowledge of the
                    company soared, with 88% of individuals polled in one survey saying that they knew of Dow. This was a major rise, and
                    the new number of those who knew of the company was comparable to some of America's largest corporations. This meant
                    Dow's actions could now have a big impact on US citizens and their opinions.

                    </p>
                    <p>In Vietnam, napalm had horrifying, cruel consequences. It caused severe burns all over the body (worse than those caused
                    by regular fire) and melted the flesh off. Wounds caused by it were also too deep to heal, and there was no real way to
                    put the fire out except by smothering it. Thus, when people would try to wipe it off, this only caused the fire to
                    spread, resulting in immense pain. Soldiers seeing these impacts first hand described burnt eyelids that couldn't be
                    shut and flesh that looked like “swollen, raw meat.” Furthermore, in an enclosed environment, napalm caused the carbon
                    monoxide poisoning of those not directly hit, which was incredibly dangerous and painful.

                As Vietnam was the first televised war, people from the US began seeing images of civilian casualties caused by napalm
                bombs. Newspapers and magazines showcased them, as well, including a January 1967 article in Ramparts magazine, which
                showed color photographs of mutilated Vietnamese children, such as the artifact above. These images and the use of
                napalm fueled the anti-war sentiment and movement, and they helped encourage Martin Luther King Jr. go public with his
                opposition to the war.

            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing the substance's horrific consequences and knowing of Dow as its manufacturer, many students also began to protest
                recruiters from Dow coming onto college campuses. In October 1966, the first demonstrations occurred at the University
                of California Berkeley in California and the Wayne State University in Michigan. Over the next year, over a hundred more
                protests would take place. In this way, Dow became even more publicized. For some students, it became a “badge of honor”
                to be interviewed by Dow recruiters, causing the number of interviews to increase. In interview rooms, recruiters were
                often trapped, spat on, forced to leave through back exits, and called “baby killers” for the company's actions.

            </p>
            <p>
                In an attempt to improve the company's image, Dow distributed “Napalm News” to employees and held an aggressive public
                relations campaign. It claimed that, according to military officials, napalm was only being used on military targets and
                that the company wasn't responsible for the military's actions. Despite this, the images and news coverage coming from
                Vietnam drastically impacted people's opinions of the Dow company, making it the target of anti-war activism. Due to the
                extreme backlash and losing the contract for producing napalm, the Dow company stopped making the substance in 1969.

            </p>
            <p>
                Anger about the war also drove annoyance at and distrust in the government, with many believing that the war was being
                gravely mishandled and that the US was being unnecessarily cruel. This created a divide between officials and the
                people, filled with heavy skepticism and suspicion of government actions, which exists even today. Although napalm
                wasn't the original reason why citizens got angry, it did add to their anger. In fact, the substance was even used as a
                symbol for the war by activists in order to bring into question the military tactics being used.

            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, this artifact was selected as it was one of the major things driving public opinion against the Vietnam War. It
                helped to fuel many protests and thus had a huge impact on how the people viewed the US's military tactic of using
                napalm, along with harming public sentiment about the Dow company.
